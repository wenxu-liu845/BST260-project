# BST260-project
The final project contains 6 documents.
1. Two csv files, named COVID-19_Vaccinations_in_the_United_States_Jurisdiction.csv and United_States_COVID-19_Cases_and_Deaths_by_State_over_Time.csv, as inputs to the final_project.rmd
2. Another csv file named bigtable.csv as the input to the shiny app
3. A Rmd file containing all analysis codes other than the shiny app
4. A directory containing app.R
5. A html file generated by the rmd file.

First, put the two csv files about vaccine and cases_and_deaths with the rmd file and run the rmd file.
Second, in order to run the shiny app, put bigtable.csv into the same directory where the shiny app is and run the document.
