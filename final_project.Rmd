```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
vaccine<-read.csv("COVID-19_Vaccinations_in_the_United_States_Jurisdiction.csv")
case_death<-read.csv("United_States_COVID-19_Cases_and_Deaths_by_State_over_Time.csv")
```



```{r}
case_death<-case_death %>%
  select(c(1,2,3,8)) %>%
  rename(Date=submission_date) 
  
vaccine<-vaccine %>%
  select(c(1,3,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,26,28,30,32,34,36,38,40,42,43,44,46,47,48,50,51,52,54,55,56,58,60,62,64,66,67,68)) %>%
  rename(state=Location) 

comb<-right_join(case_death,vaccine,by=c("Date","state"))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
